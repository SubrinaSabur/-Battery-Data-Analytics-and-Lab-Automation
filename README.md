# Battery-Data-Analytics-and-Lab-Automation
This project analyzes battery cycling data, detects and removes anomalies using machine learning and statistical methods, and visualizes results using Power BI. It also includes unit and integration testing (Pytest), and Sphinx-based documentation.
## 📁 Folder Structure

- `data/`: Raw and cleaned data files  
- `scripts/`: Data cleaning and segmentation Python scripts  
- `tests/`: Unit and integration test scripts  
- `docs/`: Sphinx documentation source and build  
- `dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard file  
- `notebook.ipynb`: Analysis and pipeline in Colab  
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies list  
- `README.md`: This file

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for full pipeline analysis.

3. Open documentation:
    - Navigate to `docs/build/html/index.html` and open in a browser.

## 🧪 Testing

Pytest has been used for both unit and integration testing of core functions.
